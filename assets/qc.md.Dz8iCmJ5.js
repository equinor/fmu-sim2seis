These represent the initial step in the process and can serve as the first point of verification.</li><li>Inputs should also be validated, i.e., the <code>eclipse</code> <code>.INIT</code> and <code>.UNRST</code> files, as well as volume fraction grids from the geomodel. For example, low-pressure outliers in <code>eclipse</code> runs can lead to errors in fluid property estimation.</li><li>Comparison between the primary influencing factors of 4D response, i.e., changes in pressure and saturation, correlated to the seismic amplitude or relative acoustic impedance response.</li></ul><p>The documentation for <code>pem</code> provides more detailed information on the process of calibrating rock physics models. Much of the workflow in <code>sim2seis</code> is less dependent on parameter settings, except for the Seismic Forward modelling component. It is important to understand the settings in the XML model files and conduct tests to optimise parameters.</p><p>There are several options available for QC of results from <code>sim2seis</code>, and the workflow is not restricted to any specific application.
