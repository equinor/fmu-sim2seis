It can be used for QC of grids from <code>pem</code> and seismic cubes from <code>sim2seis</code>. At present, there is no file format for attribute maps and horizons that are common to both <code>xtgeo</code> and ResInsight.</p><h2 id="grids-in-resinsight" tabindex="-1">Grids in ResInsight <a class="header-anchor" href="#grids-in-resinsight" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Grids in ResInsight&quot;">​</a></h2><p><br><br></p><h3 id="grid-import-in-resinsight" tabindex="-1">Grid Import in ResInsight <a class="header-anchor" href="#grid-import-in-resinsight" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Grid Import in ResInsight&quot;">​</a></h3><p>It is possible to import grids and grid properties in <code>.roff</code> format. Grids and grid properties can be imported into a ResInsight project in one operation, or the grid properties can be added after the grid is imported.</p><p>Eclipse simulation runs can also be used to define the grid, and the results from <code>pem</code> can be added as properties. This enables cross-plotting of static and dynamic properties that are input to <code>pem</code> with <code>pem</code> results, allowing verification of their expected relationships.</p><p><code>File =&gt; Import =&gt; Roff Grid Models =&gt; Import ROFF Case</code></p><img src="'+o+'" alt="Import ROFF grid and grid properties"><span id="figure-1-grid-import"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Import of grid and grid properties to ResInsight.</span><br><br><h3 id="grid-visualisation" tabindex="-1">Grid Visualisation <a class="header-anchor" href="#grid-visualisation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Grid Visualisation&quot;">​</a></h3><p>3D visualisation of grid properties is available once the grid and properties are loaded. A 3D view is set up by default, and it can be modified through the <em>Property Editor</em>. In the <strong>3D View</strong> properties under the grid, the selection of which property to display is done via the <strong>Cell Result</strong> property.
