# Static and Dynamic Input

`sim2seis` is a step in a multidisciplinary workflow, designed to integrate with models used for static and dynamic 
properties, such as the geomodel and the reservoir simulator. Static and dynamic parameters are input to the `pem` 
(petro-elastic model). Detailed documentation is available in [fmu-pem](https://equinor.github.io/fmu-pem/).

## YAML File

There is no section for the `pem` in the YAML file for `sim2seis`, as a dedicated YAML file is provided for the `pem`.
