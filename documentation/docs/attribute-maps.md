# Attribute Maps

Attribute maps can be generated both from observed seismic data and from modelled seismics. The definition of intervals
for estimating attribute maps is controlled by a separate YAML file.

## YAML File Section
Default values typically apply for attribute map generation in the `sim2seis` configuration file, as most information is
derived from the dedicated interval definition file. [Figure 1](#igure-1-seismic-attributes-in-yaml) shows the relevant
sections of the configuration file. `webviz_map` refers to export of attribute maps in formats that can be read by
`webviz` and `ert` for visualisation and history matching.

In addition, the file name for the interval definition file is specified in the main part of the configuration YAML  
file:
```yaml
attribute_definition_file: modelled_data_intervals_drogon.yml
```

## Interval Definition YAML  File
The interval definition file provides flexibility in defining intervals, resulting in a complex structure.
[Figure 2](#figure-2-interval-definiiton-in-yaml) illustrates the structure of the interval definition YAML file.

#### Global Section
The `global` section defines parameters that apply to all interval definitions unless overridden later:

- Horizon path: Controlled by `fmu-dataio`, default value shown.
- Attributes: Select attributes to highlight important features in the 4D seismic.
- Scale factor: Used to match values in similar attributes from observed seismic data.
- Metadata fields: Used in `fmu-dataio`.

#### Cube Section
- Cube names: Arbitrary values.
- Cube prefix: Concatenated with seismic difference dates defined in the global config file.
- Seismic path: Controlled by `fmu-dataio`, default value shown.
- Vertical domain: Default is `depth`.

#### Formations Section
Several formations can be defined under each cube. Interval settings apply to all attribute calculations listed in the 
`global` section unless specific values are set. Intervals can be defined in two ways:

1. **Top and Base Horizon**: Specify the top and base horizons, with optional shifts for each.
2. **Top Horizon and Interval Length**: Specify the top horizon and the interval length, with an optional shift of the 
   top horizon.

For example:
- For `relai_depth` cubes:
  - `min` and `mean` are calculated from `Top Volantis` shifted 5 ms up to `Base Volantis` shifted 10 ms down.
  - `rms` is calculated from `Top Volantis` shifted 15 ms up to `Base Volantis`.
- For `amplitude_depth` cubes:
  - `mean` has a separate interval definition from `rms` and `min`.
  - `min` has a different scaling factor than the others.
